""" An object is an incarnation of the requirements, traits, and qualities assigned to a specific class """


""" Each subclass is more specialized (or more specific) than its superclass. Conversely, each superclass 
is more general (more abstract) than any of its subclasses."""


""" Inheritance
Let's define one of the fundamental concepts of object programming, named inheritance. 
Any object bound to a specific level of a class hierarchy inherits all the traits (as well as the 
requirements and qualities) defined inside any of the superclasses."""


""" every existing object may be equipped with three groups of attributes:
1)  an object has a name that uniquely identifies it within its home namespace (although there may be some anonymous 
    objects, too)
2)  an object has a set of individual properties which make it original, unique or outstanding (although it's possible
    that some objects may have no properties at all)
3)  an object has a set of abilities to perform specific activities, able to change the object itself, or some of 
    the other objects."""


""" Whenever you describe an object and you may use:

a noun - you probably define the object's name;
an adjective - you probably define the object's property;
a verb - you probably define the object's activity.
"""


"""  A class is an idea (more or less abstract) which can be used to create a number of incarnations â€“ 
such an incarnation is called an object."""
